# Quick Description
Game in progress coded in Rust and using GGEZ. The game's end goal is to have a huge gun in the center that you have to collect bodies of enemies to craft more ammo. This is implemented using A* pathfinding for enemies and workers. While the gun is fed lists of coordinates it correlates to rotation using nalgebra to correct itself and activate a fire animation.
